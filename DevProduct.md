========================================================
type: section

You can use this application to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of your vehicle. You are required to select two numbers which are

1. the horse power of your vehicle
2. the weight of your vehicle.

The weight of the vehicle is measured in the unit of 1000lb. For example, 3.5 represents 3500lb.


Large Horse Power or Weight Decreases the Miles Per Gallon
